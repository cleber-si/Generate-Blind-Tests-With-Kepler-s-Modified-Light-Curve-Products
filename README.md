# Generate-Blind-Tests-With-Kepler-s-Modified-Light-Curve-Products

Sketches of scripts to generate blind tests data with injected signals in Kepler's space telescope light curves.

The Modified Light Curve Products have five sets of simulated data, three of which are being used here (INJ1, INJ2, INJ3).

See the [Simulated Data for Completeness and Reliability](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/KeplerSimulated.html) page for more information about the dataset.
